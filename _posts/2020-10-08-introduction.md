# New beginnings

It's taken me *a long time* to get to this point, but I'm so happy I got myself together to build my own website!
There's so many things I can't wait to share with y'all. From engineering, to opinion posts, to random rants, there's so many things I wanted to talk about that I didn't want to post on Medium. So, this is going to be where those thoughts go.
