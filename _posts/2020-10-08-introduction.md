The COVID-19 pandemic made this year *extremely* difficult on everyone. From the constant stream of depressing news, to the endless amount of tasks your job (and/or online class) hands out, it seems like the dread will never end. How do you find the light at the end of the tunnel? How can you enjoy today? I'll share some tips I use to get through this socially distanced lockdown.

# 1. Disconnect from Social Media

It's easy to drown in the sea of information social media and the news throws at us. From COVID-19, to the Black Lives Matter movement and the controversy surrounding the U.S. election, it's a nonstop waterfall. If you feel overwhelmed, try silencing your phone, closing your internet tabs and taking a walk. Disconnecting allows us to recharge our mental energy and center our thoughts. It's important to take care of your mental health during this weird time, and decreasing your screen time is one way to do it.

# 2. Start a New Hobby

If you've been putting off learning a new language, cooking a new recipe, investing in the stock market or remodeling your bathroom, now is the time to do so. We've never had so much time inside before, so take advantage and do something you've always wanted to do! There are lots of examples of total body transformations, career changes and YouTube channels started during this pandemic. While you don't have to put pressure on yourself to completely change your life, devoting your time to something new is a great way to occupy your mind while the pandemic has slowed the outside world to a standstill.

# 3. Reach Out to Family and Friends 

Something that's greatly helped me during this time is to consistently check in on my family and friends. A lot of the time we take our immediate family for granted and don't go below the surface when calling or texting them. Millions of people have lost loved ones due to COVID-19. We have to support those that have experienced loss, and we have to make the most of the time we have with our loved ones now.
