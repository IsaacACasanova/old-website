The COVID-19 pandemic made this year *extremely* difficult on everyone. From the constant stream of depressing news, to the endless amount of tasks your job (and/or online class) hands out, it seems like the dread will never end. How do you find the light at the end of the tunnel? How can you enjoy today? I'll share some tips I use to get through this socially distanced lockdown.

# 1. Disconnect from Social Media

It's all too easy to get stuck in the sea of information social media gives us. From COVID to the Black Lives Matter movement and the ongoing election, there's so much to keep tabs on. The best thing you can do for yourself is to silence your phones, close your internet tabs and take a walk.

# 2. Start a New Hobby

If you've been putting off learning a new language, cooking a new recipe, investing in the stock market or remodeling your bathroom, now is the time to do so. We've never spent so much time inside before, so take advatage and get a jump on as many side projects as you can. You never know, one of the ventures you start during quarantine can bring in a good source of second income. You may even be able to shelf your current job and pursue your new business full time.
