I'm a software engineer born and raised in [Bridgeport, CT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport,_Connecticut) who lives in Brooklyn, NY. My passions include skateboarding, listening to music, learning new languages and playing the guitar. I'm an iOS Engineer by trade, with skills in backend technologies like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), and more. It allows me to reason about systems at large, and borrow techniques from other disciplines and apply them to Swift. I currently work at [JOOR](https://joor.com/).
